I am a PhD candidate in Education Policy and Program Evaluation. My research focuses on identifying how the organization of schools impacts stratification and economic mobility, with a focus on lower income and immigrant students.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked as a Research Analyst in the Education and Crime Labs at UChicago and was a middle school mathematics teacher. I hold a B.Sc. in Economics from Georgetown University and an Ed.M. in Education Policy from Harvard.
